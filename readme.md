# Hash Function Optimizer

## Overview
This program implements a hash function and optimizes its performance. utilizes different optimization techniques such as Hill Climbing,
Simulated Annealing, and Nelder-Mead to find an optimal set of parameters for the hash function, reducing
collisions, and improving efficiency.

## Features.
  - **Hill Climbing**
  - **Simulated Annealing**
  - **Nelder-Mead**
- Displays results for the optimized parameters and collision counts.

## Usage
Run the file in VSCode, ensure all necessary libraries are installed.

### Function:
1. Creates a hash table.
2. Optimizes the hash function parameters with:
   - **Hill Climbing**
   - **Simulated Annealing**
   - **Nelder-Mead**
4. Displays the results, showing the optimized parameters and collision counts.

### The Methods:
Each works a little differently, but each can provide results.
- **Hill Climbing**: Makes small changes stpe by step, moves in the direction of the best results gradually.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Explores wide range of options, gets more focused in as it goes.
- **Nelder-Mead**: Explores multiple options at once, pretty accurate but a little more complex than the others.
