# Hash Function Optimizer

## Overview
This program implements a hash function and optimizes its performance. It utilizes different optimization techniques such as Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Nelder-Mead to find an optimal set of parameters for the hash function, reducing collisions and improving efficiency.

## Features
- **Hill Climbing**
- **Simulated Annealing**
- **Nelder-Mead**
- Displays results for the optimized parameters and collision counts.

## Usage
Run the file in VSCode and ensure all necessary libraries are installed.

### Function:
1. Creates a hash table.
2. Optimizes the hash function parameters with:
   - **Hill Climbing**
   - **Simulated Annealing**
   - **Nelder-Mead**
3. Displays the results, showing the optimized parameters and collision counts.

### The Methods:
Each works a little differently but can provide results:
- **Hill Climbing**: Makes small changes step by step, moving gradually toward the best results.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Explores a wide range of options and gets more focused as it goes.
- **Nelder-Mead**: Explores multiple options at once, is highly accurate but more complex than the others.
