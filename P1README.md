# Machine Learning with Scikit Learn

## Project 1 Overview

This project covers different machine learening techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, and time series analysis. All using Scikit learn. This was a great hands on project to get some simple experience with these methods.

## Subquestions 1-4

### 1. **Classification with the Iris Dataset**

- **Approach/steps**: 
  - Referenced classify knn iris helper code
  - Used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset
  - Visualized classifications
  - Produced a classification report

- **Performance**:
  - The visualization was detailed and handled all necessary elements
  - Precision, recall, and F1-score were all output as well

- **Challenges**:
  - Imported classification_report to get the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class

### 2. **Simple Linear Regression with a Synthetic Dataset**

- **Approach/steps**:
  - Referecned helper code for MSE and linear regression
  - Created a synthetic dataset
  - Trained a linear regression model and evaluated it using MSE
  - Visualized the data, regression line, and predicted points

- **Performance**:
  - MSE indacator, visualization was sound

- **Challenges**:
  - Making sure MSE was implemented correctly

### 3. **Clustering with a Synthetic Dataset**

- **Approach/steps**:
  - K-means helpercode
  - Generated synthetic data with three distinct clusters
  - Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm
  - Visualize the clusters and centroids

- **Performance**:
  - Visualization seemed to indicate it worked well

- **Challenges**:
  - Very similar to the helper code, no issues

---

### 4. **Time Series Analysis with Synthetic Data**

- **Approach/Steps**:
  - Referenced some linear regression helper code
  - Generated synthetic time series data with a trend, seasonal component, and random noise
  - Fit a linear regression model to the data to capture the trent
  - Visualized the original time series and the trend line

- **Performance**:
  - Overall it looked like it seemed to work well based on the visualization
  - The line did seem to be a bit above the plotted data though

- **Challenges**:
  - The seasonal compnent required some additional attention

## Summary

This project provided handd on experience with basic machine learning techniques. I found the visualizations especially helpful in understanding what is actually occuring with each technique.
